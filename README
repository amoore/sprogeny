This program allows you to program your police radio scanner with
frequencies and other information from radioreference.com. I have a
Uniden BC296D, so I'm starting with support from that. It's written in
python.

Update as of July 5, 2009: I dropped and broke my scanner, so I
probably will not keep developing this for now.
